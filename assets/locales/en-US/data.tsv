$HELP_INTRODUCTION_0	Hello! <tap to continue>
$HELP_INTRODUCTION_1	Welcome to the Mimic Rush tutorial
$HELP_INTRODUCTION_2	This is your pad...
$HELP_INTRODUCTION_3	...there are many like it,<N>but this one is yours...
$HELP_INTRODUCTION_4	...and this is the master pad
$HELP_INTRODUCTION_5	Your objective is to copy to your pad<N>what you see in the master pad
$HELP_INTRODUCTION_6	To change a tile color to orange<N>you just have to tap on it
$HELP_INTRODUCTION_7	So let's start tapping!
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_0	Good job!
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_1	As you see you've got some points!
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_2	It is one point every correct tile...
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_3	...and five points every time<N>you finish to copy a whole master pad
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_4	But remember: the clock is ticking
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_5	The game ends when the<N>countdown reaches zero...
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_6	...but you recover one second every<N>time you finish a pad
$HELP_FIRSTROUND_7	Ready to play hard?
$HELP_ROTATION_0	Hey, that is rotating!
$HELP_ROTATION_1	From time to time the master pad<N>will rotate to challenge you
$HELP_ROTATION_2	Dont worry, this rotation will<N>be reset after last few seconds
$HELP_ROTATION_3	You also have got this <N>orange dot over your pad...
$HELP_ROTATION_4	...which matches the other one<N>on the master pad
$HELP_ROTATION_5	This reference point will help you<N>when a rotation happens
$HELP_ROTATION_6	Ready to continue?
$HELP_MISTAKE_0	Ouch!
$HELP_MISTAKE_1	You've tapped on a wrong tile
$HELP_MISTAKE_2	When you make a mistake<N>you lose a second
$HELP_MISTAKE_3	Fewer mistakes you make<N>more it will be the time available
$HELP_MISTAKE_4	Ready for the next move?
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_0	How is it going?<N>Getting the hang of it?
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_1	Next to the score number<N>you can see a circle
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_2	This circle get filled to show<N>how close you are to a new highscore
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_3	As you see you are very close<N>just few more points!
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_4	The circle next to the countdown<N>shows the time left
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_5	Each circle will become green when<N>gain points or seconds...
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_6	...and red when you lose them
$HELP_HIGHSCORE_7	Ready to make a new highscore?
$HELP_NEWHIGHSCORE_0	Great, you did it!
